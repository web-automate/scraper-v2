export const artSchool = 'create a soft, understated image with an art-school aesthetic. If people are present, preserve their identity while using gentle natural light, muted colors, and a relaxed, slightly awkward pose and place them in a simple, everyday setting such as a studio, classroom, or quiet street. Otherwise, treat the scene or object as the subject or subjects, using gentle light, muted colors, and intimate framing. The mood should feel intimate, youthful, and casually artistic rather than polished or glamorous.';

export const doodle = 'create a naive, childlike doodle with rough, uneven black linework. If people are present, preserve their identity while using exaggerated, awkward proportions, wobbly outlines, and endearingly cute expressions with frantic curls or jagged lines for hair. Otherwise, treat the scene or object as the subject, using simple shapes, unsteady strokes, and a loose, scribbly style that looks hand-drawn without precision.

export const dramatic = 'create a dramatic black-and-white photograph with a moody, cinematic atmosphere using high-contrast lighting. If people are present, preserve their identity while rendering them as appearing wet, as if just caught in the rain, with irregular water droplets and streaks on the face, and damp, slightly clumped hair with loose strands. Otherwise, treat the scene or object as the subject, emphasizing wet textures, deep shadows, and bright highlights to carve out form. The background should be dark and minimal, and the overall mood intense, emotional, and photographic with real rain texture and dramatic tonal depth.';

export const neonPunk = 'create a futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic characterized by high-contrast neon lighting in cyan and magenta tones. If people are present, preserve their identity while outfitting them in tactical tech-wear with glowing accents, placed within a rain-slicked, neon-lit urban environment.

export const clay3d = 'create a charming 3D illustration style resembling digital claymation or toy design with soft, rounded edges. If people are present, preserve their identity while simplifying them into friendly, chunky shapes with a tactile, plasticine texture and gentle, diffuse lighting that creates soft shadows.

The colors should be cheerful and pastel, making the overall mood feel cute, tangible, and playful like a physical diorama.';

export const vintageFilm = 'create a vintage analog photography aesthetic, specifically mimicking 35mm film with natural grain and imperfect color shifts. If people are present, preserve their identity while capturing them with a soft focus, warm, slightly muted color tones, and natural light leaks or lens flares. Otherwise, treat the scene or object with the same nostalgic filter, emphasizing texture and film artifacts. The overall mood should feel candid, nostalgic, and warm, like a rediscovered memory from the 1970s.';

export const realisticPhoto = 'create a hyper-realistic, 8k high-resolution photograph. If people are present, preserve their identity strictly while capturing minute skin textures, realistic hair strands, and lifelike eye reflections under balanced, studio-quality lighting. Otherwise, treat the scene or object with macro-level detail and physics-based lighting accuracy. Use a standard 50mm lens perspective with a slight depth of field to separate the subject from a realistic background, ensuring the image looks like a high-end stock photo without artistic stylization.';

export const graphicDesign = 'create a modern commercial graphic design aesthetic suitable for banners or pamphlets. If people are present, preserve their identity while integrating them into a clean composition with smooth masking and professional lighting. Otherwise, treat the scene or object as the hero element of an advertisement.

export const cinematic = 'create a widescreen cinematic shot reminiscent of a high-budget hollywood movie. If people are present, preserve their identity while using dramatic key lighting, rim lighting to separate them from the background, and an intense or contemplative expression. Otherwise, treat the scene or object as a pivotal plot device.

If people are present, preserve their identity while placing them in a flattering pose with soft, golden-hour lighting and a genuine, celebratory expression.

export const pixelArt = 'create a retro 16-bit pixel art aesthetic reminiscent of 90s SNES adventure games. If people are present, preserve their identity while translating them into recognizable pixel sprites with limited color palettes and distinct shading.

Ensure all lines and shapes are constructed from a visible pixel grid without anti-aliasing, using bright, nostalgic colors to create a playful and digital atmosphere.';
